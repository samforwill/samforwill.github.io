## Technical Projects

### Building a Party Support Model & 2022 Midterm Voting Behavior
Employed the 2021 American Community Survey (demographic, housing, economic, and social profiles) to create 450 unique features for predicting Partisan Voter Index (PVI) scores across all 435 U.S. congressional districts. RidgeCV model correctly predicted PVI scores of post-redistricting U.S. congressional districts with within 4.3 percentage points of true PVI. Created interactive dashboard to present insights on PVI score, 2022 electoral margin, U.S. Representative info, and visualizations for top predictive features.

### NLP Analysis of Messaging for 2022 Democratic Candidates
Used unsupervised learning to analyze the campaign tweets of Reps. Chris Deluzio and Marie Gluesenkamp-Perez, two Democratic candidates who significantly overperformed in Republican-leaning districts. Applied Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on GloVe-embedded Twitter data to uncover distinct messaging themes, highlighting differences in strategies around union solidarity, reproductive rights, and anti-extremism.
