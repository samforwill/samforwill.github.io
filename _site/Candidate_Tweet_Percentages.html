Our region is getting huge &lt;br&gt;investments in our AI &amp; robotics sector thanks to &lt;br&gt;the American Rescue Plan (ya know, the bill that &lt;br&gt;every single Republican voted against)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're lucky to have the Beaver Valley Power &lt;br&gt;Station right here in #PA17. It's a major source &lt;br&gt;of both solid union jobs and reliable clean &lt;br&gt;energy powering our region. &lt;br&gt;https://nytimes.com/2022/07/05/bus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're getting millions in healthcare savings and &lt;br&gt;huge investments in western PA manufacturing. &lt;br&gt;This bill is a big win for #PA17.","&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm committed to taking the actions necessary to &lt;br&gt;confront the climate crisis. My opponent thinks &lt;br&gt;climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese &lt;br&gt;government to make money. #WA03 needs a Member of &lt;br&gt;Congress, not an extreme conspiracy theorist. &lt;br&gt;Thank you @LCVoters for your support. &lt;br&gt;https://t.co/BvvQu35wKN","&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patriotism means fighting to bring back jobs &amp; &lt;br&gt;make more stuff here to lower costs. #TeamDeluzio &lt;br&gt;is proud to be the pro-worker &amp; pro-family &lt;br&gt;campaign in #PA17. But I'm sure the greedy &lt;br&gt;corporations gouging us and shipping our jobs &lt;br&gt;overseas love the corporate exec we're up &lt;br&gt;against.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lousy trade deals + corporate greed have killed &lt;br&gt;our jobs for far too long. We see it here in &lt;br&gt;#PA17, from the Alle-Kiski Valley to Aliquippa, &lt;br&gt;and I'm not going to let our jobs go overseas. We &lt;br&gt;need to bring back manufacturing, make stuff here &lt;br&gt;again, and do it with union workers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;More of this. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 We're in the economic fight of &lt;br&gt;our lives with China, and it's time we start &lt;br&gt;taking our jobs back starting right here in &lt;br&gt;#PA17.","&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't take corporate PAC money. I rely on &lt;br&gt;grassroots contributors to fund this campaign. &lt;br&gt;Please chip in now to keep our new TV ad on the &lt;br&gt;air, defeat Joe Kent, and flip #WA03 blue. &lt;br&gt;https://t.co/iQsEmAa5kB&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ask any economist, this kind of market &lt;br&gt;consolidation is dangerous for consumers &lt;br&gt;everywhere, it just happens that these &lt;br&gt;\u201cconsumers\u201d are our most vulnerable children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year, I paid more in taxes than Jeff Bezos, &lt;br&gt;the second-richest person in the country \u2013 you &lt;br&gt;read that right. This system doesn\u2019t work for &lt;br&gt;everyday folks. Stand with me to demand a fair &lt;br&gt;tax code that forces the ultra-wealthy to pay &lt;br&gt;their fair share: &lt;br&gt;https://secure.ngpvan.com/rpEHsxFarEiS39oH9kgHlQ2","&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Want to know why your burger has gotten so &lt;br&gt;expensive? Four giant meatpacking companies &lt;br&gt;control 85% of the market, and they're setting &lt;br&gt;prices, ripping us off, and making fat profits. &lt;br&gt;[1/2]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex. Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should make stuff here again. Make it with &lt;br&gt;union workers, grow the middle class, and give &lt;br&gt;small businesses a chance against corporate &lt;br&gt;giants who are gouging us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex.
